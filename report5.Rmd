See also the [full scenario details](`r paste0("https://github.com/covid19-forecast-hub-europe/covid19-scenario-hub-europe/wiki/Round-", params$round)`) for more detail on the common set of assumptions teams used to create their models.

In Round `r params$round`, we asked modellers to start their projections from the `r scenarios[[round_text]][["origin_date"]]`. Data after this date were not included, and as a result, model projections are unlikely to fully account for later information on, for example, the changing variant landscape or behavioural patterns. 


# Shared assumptions
We asked all modellers to include the following parameters and assumptions, beyond the assumptions of the Scenario Table above:

- Any vaccination campaign begins on 01-10-2023 and last for 90 days.
- New/updated vaccinates will not be a "game changer" compared to previously observed VEs.
- There is sufficient vaccine supply.
- No additional new vaccination campaigns, except those specified in the scenarios.
- No plateau for existing immunity against infection.
- The parameters for the waning speed of protection relates to the waning since the most recent vaccination or infection.
- No new "game changer" variants.
- No new public health and social measures (non-pharmaceutical interventions / NPIs).
- No changes in demography given the short timeframe.
- No novel drugs that strongly impact COVID-19 burden or SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
- Data sources used: modellers use ECDC provided data for death and hospitalisation incidence, but are free to use any data source for case data. (For countries that have discontinued reporting of an epi indicator, we ask teams to initiate model projections starting at the last reliable data point.)

# Assumptions left to modeller judgement
Modellers should use their own judgement and relevant literature if making assumptions about a number of modelling aspects. Note that the resulting between-team differences due to these assumptions are desired, and 
reflect uncertainty regarding these aspects. They are a main contributor to the uncertainty of the analysis results. 

- Vaccination (and uptake levels) of at-risk individuals of all ages as well as vaccination of healthcare workers.
- Functional shape of waning immunity against infection and against severe outcomes (following the above specified decrease of immunity against infection within the specified time frame).
- The absolute value of vaccine effectiveness and protection from past infections for all outcomes.
- The under-ascertainment factor and the impact of downscaled testing.
- Contact rates in response to infection rates.
- Impact of seasonality, including seasonal behavioural changes.


# Round 5 submissions
Round 5 has received submissions from six international modelling teams from across the EU/EEA and beyond. Submissions are from a diversity of modelling approaches, adding to the between-team variability of projections. 
One team submitted projections for 30 EU/EEA countries, one team submitted for 6 countries, and 4 teams for one EU/EEA country.

# Results

For each model and scenario, we evaluated the proportion of the three outcomes (deaths, hospitalisations, infections), that is due to a new variant and/or faster (i.e., pessimistic) waning. The cumulative outcomes were compared between baseline scenario A and the other scenarios. The results were aggregated across different countries. Figure 1 below shows that pessimistic waning (scenario C) in most models and outcomes leads to a substantial increase in cumulative burden compared to optimistic waning (scenario A). The introduction of a new variant also showed a substantial impact on the cumulative burden (i.e., comparing scenarios A and B, or C and D) across most models and outcomes. There is a substantial variation in precise values between different models, which is partly due to variation between models, model assumptions, as well as aggregation across different countries (see Table 1 above to see number of countries modelled by each model). Please note these scenarios have not explored the impact of future vaccination campaigns and thus cannot be used to estimate the impact of vaccination. We plan to explore this in the future scenario rounds.

_Figure 1: Relative change in cumulative infections (left), hospitalisations (middle) and deaths (right) across scenarios, relative to scenario A. The light and dark boxes show the  80% and 50% quantiles, respectively, and the black dot shows the median across samples and countries. The four scenarios are: (A) optimistic waning and no new variant, (B) optimistic waning and a new variant, (C) pessimistic waning and no new variant,  (D) pessimistic waning and a new variant. One model was excluded from the figure due to the low estimated number of severe outcomes in scenarios A&B. Note that we truncate the y-axis at (-0.5, 1.5)._


# Observations

Some models use local (country provided) data sources which can result in their model projections to vary both in past and current values as well as projected trends. Further harmonisation of input data and calibration periods can help with reducing the variation between models. Some teams also have experienced difficulties in calibrating the models.


Update 19/06/2023: Clarified that vaccination was not explicitly modelled in this scenario round, and the results shown here cannot be directly interpreted for future vaccination campaigns.

Update 20/06/2023: Updated Figure 1 with new Model 4 results which corrected for minor issues related to calibration of the pessistic waning scenarios.
